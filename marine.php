          <h2><u>Marine Drive</u></h2><br>

					<p>Marine Drive is a 4.3-kilometre-long boulevard in South Mumbai in the city of Mumbai. It is a 'C'-shaped six-lane concrete road along the coast, which is a natural bay. The road links Nariman Point to Babulnath and Malabar Hill. Marine Drive is situated over reclaimed land facing west-south-west. A promenade lies parallel to this road. Marine Drive is also known as the Queen's Necklace because, if viewed at night from an elevated point anywhere along the drive, the street lights resemble a string of pearls in a necklace. In 2012, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai announced that the entire road would be resurfaced, 72 years after it was originally laid.[1]

The official name for this road, though rarely used, is Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road. The promenade is lined with palm trees. At the northern end of Marine Drive is Chowpatty Beach. This is a popular beach famed for its Bhel puri (local fast food). Many restaurants also line this stretch of the road. Further down this road lies Walkeshwar, a wealthy neighbourhood of the city, also home to the Governor of Maharashtra.

Most of the buildings which were built by wealthy Parsis sport an art deco look that was popular in the 1920s and 1930s. Real estate prices along the esplanade are high. Many hotels dot the drive, most prominent among them being the 5-star Oberoi (formerly the Oberoi Hilton Tower however reverted to the original name as of early 2008), The Intercontinental, Hotel Marine Plaza, Sea Green Hotel and a few other smaller hotels. Marine Drive is the preferred connecting road between the central business district located at Nariman Point and the rest of the city.
</p>

					<p><h2>Major events</h2><br>Marine Drive has hosted the following major events in recent times.<br>

♦   In 2014, on the occasion of the 65th Republic Day of India, the Protocol Department of the Government of Maharashtra held its first parade on the lines of the Delhi Republic ♦   Day parade along the entire stretch of Marine Drive.<br>
♦   IAF airshow, October 17, 2004<br>
♦   Bombay Marathon (every year since) 9 February 2004 — an international marathon.<br>
♦   International Fleet Review 19 February 2001 — The world's major navies took part in the IFR.<br>
♦   French Festival 1988.</p>

          <h2>Chowpatty Beach</h2>
Towards the northern end of Marine Drive lies one of the oldest seafronts called Chowpatty Beach, which is famous for its bazaars and meals. Hundreds of salesmen walk across the beach to sell different varieties of items especially on Sunday evenings. Stalls featuring fast food and snacks such as Bhel Puri, Paav Bhaji, etc are set up in the area every single day. Going further down the lane, is Walkeshwar, a very affluent and posh area that gets its name from the famous and highly revered Walkeshwar Temple. In order to see the utmost celebration spirit of the Mumbai's crowd on this beach, the perfect time to visit is during Ganesh Chathurthi, the biggest gala of all for the city and state in general.

<h2>Evening Walks</h2>
Marine Drive is considered as the best pathway for an evening stride. The sight of sparkling waters of the Arabian Sea and the amazing feeling of cold breeze caressing your hair along with a long array of restaurants offering mouthwatering snacks and drinks can make any low day bright again. Needless to say that these streets are a perfect hang out place for all age groups! For the elderly, Nana-Nani Park is an absolute haven and is quite a recent attraction. This is the perfect hangout spot once you are in the city of Mumbai. The 3 km long Marine Drive is a natural bay and also forms a portion of the famous skyline of Mumbai. It has access to some of the major corporate centers, recreation activities and also places of entertainment.

<h2>High Prices</h2>
The real estate value of this walkway is one of the highest in India and ranks fourth when compared to the world statistics. Numerous celebrities have their houses built here and this area has become one of the premier residential communities. Also, the 5 star hotel Oberoi is along the same path with many other noted restaurants lined along this walkway.
